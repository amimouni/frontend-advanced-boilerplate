      title_right: Involvement
      text_right: Au Départ had been dormant for decades, so my mission was to prepare the revival of the brand. My work consisted of nurturing the development of the identity while respecting the brand''s DNA and essence. This included the reshaping of the logo, the monogram, and the creation of a new line of bags, trunk and leather goods.

      text_middle: Social networking-enabled photo sharing and filtering application for the Apple iPhone, launched in September 2012. Starmatic made its debut on the Apple App Store on September 5, 2012, gained almost 500,000 users, and was discontinued in May 2014.

      title_2: "Mobile template designs"
      text_1: Starmatic is a toy-camera app and visual creativity platform based on the legendary Kodak Brownie Starmatic. The app crafts a new visual and social experience by putting picture and user experience quality center stage, while simultaneously modeling a much beloved toy camera from Eastman Kodak made during the late 1950s. Fun to use, but with deep feature set, Starmatic is designed to attract serious iPhoneographers as well as entry mobile photo enthusiasts.
      image_3: starmatic02.png
      text_3: The filters are grouped as rolls of film (a wink to the 127 negatives used by Starmatic cameras) and the app even comes with the “Starmacolor” film, featuring 16 filters for a variety of color processing not found in previous apps -- a differentiator that took several extra months developing in iOS and that was done in collaboration with experienced iPhoneographers and Brownie lovers.

      text_5: Unique gestures for browsing between pictures and within picture streams. Repost others pictures and easily track/organize favorites. Users instantly see others most liked and favorited.
      image_7: starmatic05.png
      text_7: A camera app that emulates functions and the feel of the legendary Starmatic camera. Square, portrait and landscape pictures can all be imported. Vertical pictures can be viewed on full screen. Rich offer of filters, organized by family in a playful manner, and planned to grow.
