      title_middle: Creative Strategy - UX & UI
      text_middle: Lomi is a specialist coffee roaster, and a coffee shop. In 2016 they started selling coffee machines for professionals. I helped them create two websites that translate their skills and their art with a modern approach.
      title_left_2: Categories
      text_left_2: Product Design · Branding · Web.
      title_right: Involvement
      text_right: UX and UI. Web design. I was responsible for the experience strategy and design of the website. I lead the UX work, producing all deliverables.
    body:
      text_1: Lomi approached me with two primary objectives — to enhance their selling of coffee beans beyond their clients; and to promote their new market offers that were growing fast of coffee machines for professionals and the opening of a new space for the training school. I was tasked to clarify their diversified offer, through their different types of customers. The combination of individuals and professionals as clients meant I needed to dive into their business in the first week.
      title_2: 2 websites
      text_2: At first when Lomi came to me they had a complex offer that needed to be clarified. The idea was to have two separated websites, one for professionals with coffee machines, coffee beans and training school and one for individuals with coffee beans, the shop presentation and small coffee equipments.
      title_3: Focusing on users goals
      text_3: Although the brief was to develop better clarification for our client's customers, we stressed that engaging in two different websites; one website for professionals one for individuals was neither strategic, nor had the best interests of the users at heart. We were thrilled by the opportunity to create something more meaningful. After many brainstorming sessions and trade offs, we made the choice of separating the offers into two websites. Let''s see the story behind it.
      title_4: Starting on the same page
      text_4: Meeting with key stakeholders helped me to understand their business challenges. Together we identified risks and aligned on expectations and constructed a shared vision for the website. Following this, I crafted an experience strategy outlining our phased approach and direction for the website.
      title_5: The Discovery
      text_5: The discovery phase was a quick, high-intensity effort that allowed us to define project milestones, audit the existing work, review the competitor landscape, understand our client''s vision, and begin research into user needs, behaviours and pain‐points. We also kicked off a technical discovery phase to understand feasibility and constraints. My research revealed that the coffee beans, and the story behind it was the thing in the middle that linked all the customers.
      title_6: Use case
      text_6: Understanding the usage contexts of the website helped me develop a clear vision of the tonal expectations of our users.
      image_6: lomimachine_usecase.png
      title_7: Personas
      text_7: After designating persona types and aligning this with the phasing strategy I was able to prioritise who we would be focusing on. Our persona hypothesis consisted of five different archetypes which we used to facilitate discussions about our users needs, desires and varying contexts of use. Through careful analysis of my research, I identified sufficient behavioural variables to segment our user audience. I discussed the personas with my client to develop a clear picture of who the design of the website would target in phase 1 and later in future releases. There was two kinds of users, the professionals and the individuals. I used personas constantly throughout the project to guide design decisions, priorities, and create empathy amongst the client. Here are the stories translated in english.
      image_7: lomimachine_persona.png
      title_8: Lomi User scenario
      text_8: When an individual wants to shop at Lomi, he can go online or buy products at the coffeeshop. He can buy online coffee beans, small coffee equipments, and cupping trainings. At the coffee shop he can order a hot coffee or have lunch and get advices to buy coffee beans.
      image_8: lomimachine0.png
      title_9: User Journey
      text_9: For a professional the option of going online to buy equipment or coffee beans is possible but at this point the clients always need to talk with someone to get a better understanding of the product they are buying but it is important that they can get already as many infos as they possible through the website and that they see the panel of machines that Lomi has to offer. After having chosen the equipment they can choose to buy the maintenance services or they can buy trainings at Lomi school for their employees to learn the art of coffee from the choice of the beans to the art of brewing. Another important point is that the coffee beans can be tailor-made for a client or even conceived with him. The coffee beans will be delivered by cargo bike to the restaurant or hotel every week.
      image_9: lomimachine_userjourney.png
      title_10: Features
      text_10: By classifying features and ordering them we came to the point that what was commun for individuals and professionals was the beans, the roasting, the story and the plantation. The ordering was not the same as profesionals because professionals would mainly talk directly to Lomi to order when individuals were are buying directly at the shop or can order online and the point was trying to raise the online sell. After ordering features in different orders, we decided that it would be too confusing for individuals to have access to professional equipments so we made the choice of splitting the offer into two websites.

      title_11: Rapid wireframes
      text_11: The design of this site was very much led by the wireframes.
      image_11: lomimachine_wireframe.png
      title_12: UX and UI, a selection of the designs for this project
      text_12: Lomi Machine became the offers for professionals who needs hight quality equipements for their restaurants, hotels or coffee shops. We decided to go for an elegant and simple website for Lomi Machine that would leave space to the equipements. It was important that the offer would be very clear.
      title_13: Home page
      text_13: The design of this site was very much led by the wireframes. A solid UX & UI foundation had been laid out to cover all areas, content types and scenarios...
      image_13: lomi01.png
      title_14: Photography
      text_14: A photography brief was created to get shots specifically for the new website. It massively contributed to the aesthetic of the website.
      image_14: lomi02.png
      title_15: The story
      text_15: The communication on the story was important, alongside with the client we decided to dedicate a whole page to the story.

      image_19: lomimachine01.png
      title_20: Shop
      text_20: The machines have many options and simplifying the features choices was a very important focus. We spent a lot of time classifying machines, their pieces and options to understand how to design it better. Depending on the option you click, you get an other list of options. We came to a point where a dynamic pull-down menu made in Ajax was an obvious answer.

      text_1: Starmatic is a toy-camera app and visual creativity platform based on the legendary Kodak Brownie Starmatic. The app crafts a new visual and social experience by putting picture and user experience quality center stage, while simultaneously modeling a much beloved toy camera from Eastman Kodak made during the late 1950s. Fun to use, but with deep feature set, Starmatic is designed to attract serious iPhoneographers as well as entry mobile photo enthusiasts.
      image_3: starmatic02.png
      text_3: The filters are grouped as rolls of film (a wink to the 127 negatives used by Starmatic cameras) and the app even comes with the “Starmacolor” film, featuring 16 filters for a variety of color processing not found in previous apps - a differentiator that took several extra months developing in iOS and that was done in collaboration with experienced iPhoneographers and Brownie lovers.

      text_7: A camera app that emulates functions and the feel of the legendary Starmatic camera. Square, portrait and landscape pictures can all be imported. Vertical pictures can be viewed on full screen. Rich offer of filters, organized by family in a playful manner, and planned to grow.

      text_middle: Au Départ is a Parisian trunk-maker founded in Paris in 1834, selling luggage and travel goods. Au Départ is considered as one of the four greatest French trunk-makers alongside Louis Vuitton, Goyard and Moynat.
      title_right: Involvement
      text_right: Au Départ had been dormant for decades, so my mission was to prepare the revival of the brand. My work consisted of nurturing the development of the identity while respecting the brand''s DNA and essence. This included the reshaping of the logo, the monogram, and the creation of a new line of bags, trunk and leather goods.
