      text_middle: Monte-Carlo manages and owns four luxury hotels, five casinos, three spas, 33 restaurants. The group organizes major events year-round. During my year of work with the group, I had many important and diverse responsibilities, and delivered branding, logos, websites, mobile apps, illustrations, environmental and many printed communications.

      text_1: I helped Monte-Carlo to realign their brand and visual identity to reflect their DNA. Their marketing collateral had become confused and fussy, so I helped them find a simpler, more confident approach immersed in their history.
      title_2: The logo, rebranding with a modern approach.
      text_2: I made a search through the archives to understand the DNA of the brand and I proposed to use a font that was part of their DNA and used in the past in many of their posters. The story of the font Neutra and it's elegant touch works well with the historical and modern approach we wanted.

      title_middle: Creative Strategy - UX & UI
      text_middle: Lomi is a specialist coffee roaster, and a coffee shop. In 2016 they started selling coffee machines for professionals. I helped them create two websites that translate their skills and their art with a modern approach.
      title_left_2: Categories
      text_left_2: Product Design · Branding · Web.
      title_right: Involvement
      text_right: UX and UI. Web design. I was responsible for the experience strategy and design of the website. I lead the UX work, producing all deliverables.
    body:
      text_1: "Lomi approached me with three primary objectives, targeting both individuals and professional clients: <br/> 1. Extend the sales of coffee beans beyond their existing clientele. <br/> 2. Promote the sale of professional coffee machines. <br/> 3. Market their training school. <br/> I was tasked to clarify their offer, I needed to dive into their business in the first week."
      title_2: 2 websites
      text_2: At first when Lomi came to me they had a complex offer that needed to be clarified. The idea was to have two separate websites. One for professionals with coffee machines, coffee beans and a training school and another for individuals seeking coffee beans, a shop presentation and coffee equipment.
      title_3: Focusing on users goals
      text_3: Although the brief was to develop better clarification for our client's customers, we stressed the importance of engaging customers across two separate websites; one website for professionals and one for individuals was neither strategic, nor did it have the best interests of the users at heart. We were thrilled by the opportunity to create something more meaningful. After many brainstorming sessions and trade offs, we made the choice of separating the offers into two websites. Let''s see the story behind it.
      title_4: Starting on the same page
      text_4: Meeting with key stakeholders helped me to understand the business challenges. Together we identified risks, aligned expectations and constructed a shared vision for the website. Following this, I crafted a strategy outlining our phased approach and direction for the website.
      title_5: The Discovery
      text_5: The discovery phase was a quick, high-intensity effort that allowed us to define project milestones, audit the existing work, review the competitor landscape, understand our client''s vision, and begin research into the user needs, behaviours and pain‐points. We also kicked off a technical discovery phase to understand feasibility and constraints. My research revealed that the coffee beans, and the story behind it was the thing in the middle that linked all the customers.
      title_6: Use case
      text_6: Understanding the usage contexts of the website helped me develop a clear vision of the tonal expectations of our users.
      image_6: lomimachine_usecase.png
      title_7: Personas
      text_7: After designating persona types and aligning this with the phasing strategy I was able to prioritise who we would be focusing on. Our persona hypothesis consisted of five different archetypes which we used to facilitate discussions about our users needs, desires and varying contexts of use. Through careful analysis of my research, I identified sufficient behavioural variables to segment our user audience. I discussed the personas with my client to develop a clear picture of who the design of the website would target in phase 1 and later in future releases. There was two kinds of users, the professionals and the individuals. I used personas constantly throughout the project to guide design decisions, priorities, and create empathy amongst the client. Here are the stories translated in english.
      image_7: lomimachine_persona.png
      title_8: Lomi User scenario
      text_8: When an individual wants to shop at Lomi, he can go online or buy products at the coffeeshop. He can buy online coffee beans, small coffee equipments, and cupping trainings. At the coffee shop he can order a hot coffee or have lunch and get advices to buy coffee beans.
      image_8: lomimachine0.png
      title_9: User Journey
      text_9: For a professional the option of going online to buy equipment or coffee beans is possible but at this point the clients always need to talk with someone to get a better understanding of the product they are buying but it is important that they can get already as many infos as they possible through the website and that they see the panel of machines that Lomi has to offer. After having chosen the equipment they can choose to buy the maintenance services or they can buy trainings at Lomi school for their employees to learn the art of coffee from the choice of the beans to the art of brewing. Another important point is that the coffee beans can be tailor-made for a client or even conceived with him. The coffee beans will be delivered by cargo bike to the restaurant or hotel every week.
      image_9: lomimachine_userjourney.png
      title_10: Features
      image_10: lomi_designstory.png
      text_10: By classifying features and ordering them we came to the point that what was commun for individuals and professionals was the beans, the roasting, the story and the plantation. The ordering was not the same as profesionals because professionals would mainly talk directly to Lomi to order when individuals were are buying directly at the shop or can order online and the point was trying to raise the online sell. After ordering features in different orders, we decided that it would be too confusing for individuals to have access to professional equipments so we made the choice of splitting the offer into two websites.
      image_11: lomimachine06.png
      title_12: Task flow
      text_12: Understanding this problem began with a review of the current state of the buying process and creating a process map similar to the one in the following image, in which I mapped each step of the website''s process — from the time the user lands on the website to when he founds its way into buying a product.
      image_12: lomi_taskflow.png
      title_13: Rapid wireframes
      text_13: The design of this site was very much led by the wireframes.
      image_13: lomimachine_wireframe.png
      title_14: UX and UI, a selection of the designs for this project
      text_14: Lomi Machine became the offers for professionals who needs hight quality equipements for their restaurants, hotels or coffee shops. We decided to go for an elegant and simple website for Lomi Machine that would leave space to the equipements. It was important that the offer would be very clear.
      title_15: Home page
      text_15: The design of this site was very much led by the wireframes. A solid UX & UI foundation had been laid out to cover all areas, content types and scenarios...
      image_15: lomi01.png
      title_16: Photography
      text_16: A photography brief was created to get shots specifically for the new website. It massively contributed to the aesthetic of the website.
      image_16: lomi02.png
      title_17: The story
      text_17: The communication on the story was important, alongside with the client we decided to dedicate a whole page to the story.

      image_21: lomimachine01.png
      title_22: Shop
      text_22: The machines have many options and simplifying the features choices was a very important focus. We spent a lot of time classifying machines, their pieces and options to understand how to design it better. Depending on the option you click, you get an other list of options. We came to a point where a dynamic pull-down menu made in Ajax was an obvious answer.

      text_middle: Social networking-enabled photo sharing and filtering application for the Apple iPhone, launched in September 2012. Starmatic made its debut on the Apple App Store on September 5, 2012, gained almost 500,000 users, and was discontinued in May 2014.

      title_1: The legendary Kodak Brownie Starmatic
      text_1: Starmatic is a toy-camera app and visual creativity platform based on the legendary Kodak Brownie Starmatic. The app crafts a new visual and social experience by putting picture and user experience quality center stage, while simultaneously modeling a much beloved toy camera from Eastman Kodak made during the late 1950s. Fun to use, but with deep feature set, Starmatic is designed to attract serious iPhoneographers as well as entry mobile photo enthusiasts.
      title_2: Customer Insights & Ideation
      text_2: I partnered with the founders and one other designer to uncover insights and translate concepts into features that address customer behaviours and motivations.
      title_3: Experience Strategy & Vision
      text_3: I created frameworks and prototypes to share the vision, design principles and content strategy. This helped to evangelise ideas, gain alignment and drive decision making.
      title_4: Planning & Scope Definition
      text_4: I ran some workshops with the key stakeholders to uncover the business challenges. Together we identified the risks, aligned our expectations and constructed a shared vision for the App. To differentiate ourselves in an already competitive market, we needed to define a desirable role for the website. We were thrilled by the opportunity to create something more meaningful.
      title_5: Oversight & Coordination
      text_5: I collaborated with the other designer and the founders to translate product features for each context. Working in a collaborative culture, we opted for a lean approach that emphasized rapid sketching, prototyping, user feedback and design mockups. It created early team‐wide alignment, sparked tons of great ideas and created a strong sense of ownership across different disciplines within the team.
      title_6: Design Execution & Validation
      text_6: I designed down on iOS and I executed journeys, wireframes, prototypes and design specs.
      title_7: Customer Insights
      text_7: We conducted customer and market research to drive our planning phase.
      title_8: The iphonographers
      text_8: The primary users are people that take iPhone photography seriously. Starmatic is designed to attract serious iPhoneographers as well as entry mobile photo enthusiasts. The idea behind Starmatic is to create a unique community where anybody can express their photographic talent and develop it by being inspired by photos from others users.
      title_9: Introducing Starmatic
      image_9: starmatic_intro.png
      title_10: The vision
      text_10: Our vision for Starmatic was to be the best photo app and social network service for iphonographers. The app crafts a new visual and social experience by putting pictures and user experience center stage, while simultaneously modeling a much beloved toy camera from Eastman Kodak made during the late 1950s. Fun to use, with in-depth features, Starmatic is designed to attract serious iPhoneographers as well as entry mobile photo enthusiasts. Our users expect and trust us to know them. We envisioned the future of the photo-sharing service to be fully personalised. Quality is what we wanted our customers to shout about.
      title_11: The navigation
      text_11: We have tried to recreate the feeling that you experience when browsing beautiful lifestyle magazines or photo books. Unique gestures for browsing between pictures and within picture streams. Photos are displayed as a grid, and with the app’s infinite scroll feature, users can keep swiping until they find an image they want to open. The process is extremely fluid. Once a photo is opened, whether from the featured page or from an individual’s profile, users can swipe back and forth between photos.

      title_14: The search tool
      text_14: A focus on qualitative experience rather than quantitative. Like Vimeo vs. Youtube, or 500px vs. Flickr. Discovery section highlights trending tags, photos near you and most interesting users of the moment. Search tool browses to easily find pictures, tags and users and all results within one screen. We opted for an infinite scrolling in the feeds, and a swiping through the pictures.
      image_14: starmatic04.png
      title_15: Sharing
      text_15: Repost others pictures and easily track / organize favorites. Users instantly see others most liked and favorited photos. This allows them to repost other users photography. Images that are reposted will appear in users feed with a little repost icon in the top right hand corner and when you open up the actual image, it goes to the original image.
      image_15: starmatic_sharingnotif.png
      title_16: The camera
      text_16: A camera app that emulates functions and the feeling of the legendary Starmatic camera. Square, portrait and landscape pictures can all be imported. Vertical pictures can be viewed on full screen. The camera offer a wide range of filters, organized by family in a playful manner, with the potential to grow.
      image_16: starmatic01.png
      title_17: The filters
      text_17: Several editing features and filters set Starmatic apart from the current crop of iPhone photo apps. The filters are grouped as rolls of film (a wink to the 127 negatives used by Starmatic cameras) and the app even comes with the "Starmacolor" film, featuring 16 filters for a variety of color processing not found in previous apps -- a differentiator that took several extra months developing in iOS and that was done in collaboration with experienced iPhoneographers and Brownie lovers.
      text_18: For more demanding users, the "Starmachrome" film features 10 filters offering a soft and elegant color palette and subtle contrasts which are available to download as in-app purchases for 0.79€ or 0.99$. More films will be available soon to satisfy all photographer's unique tastes like a black & white film, etc.

      text_middle: Au Départ is a Parisian trunk-maker founded in Paris in 1834, selling luggage and travel goods. Au Départ is considered as one of the four greatest French trunk-makers alongside Louis Vuitton, Goyard and Moynat.
      title_right: Involvement
      text_right: Au Départ had been dormant for decades, so my mission was to prepare the revival of the brand. My work consisted of nurturing the development of the identity while respecting the brand''s DNA and essence. This included the reshaping of the logo, the monogram, and the creation of a new line of bags, trunk and leather goods.
